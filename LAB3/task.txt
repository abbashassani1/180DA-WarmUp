1. Please submit a screenshot of you playing your command-line game and your PyGame game with
another person.
2. Try reading a bit on one other GUI library. Sometimes you donâ€™t need a full game loop interface to
implement the games that we are working on, so you can try an easier (or more flexible) interface.
3. Describe in a short blurb how you think you want to do graphics for your project.
Creating a virtual environment using Pygame is a great way to utilize Python for interactive graphics and simulations.
Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, but it's also powerful enough for other graphical applications, 
including virtual environments.
