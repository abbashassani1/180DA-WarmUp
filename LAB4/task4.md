1: yes I see when it idle the gravity acc. is betweem 980 to 1010 and also the acc. in x,y,z is small around + and - 40 mg.
2: when acc of x and y is around + and - 40 mg and the gravity acc. is around 1015 mg, it is idle otherwise not idle.
3: I used in x direction for farward. y for backward  and z for up and I used if else statement to this classification. 
4: yes, we an use an IMU I use the gry instead of acc..
