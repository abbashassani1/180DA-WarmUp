1: yes, when it is idle the gravity acc. is between 980 to 1010 mg, and the acc. in x,y, and z is around + and - 40 mg.
2: when acc of x and y is around + and - 40 mg and the gravity acc. is around 1015 mg, it is idle otherwise, it is not idle.
3: I used in x directions for forward. y for backward  and z for up and I used the if else statement to this classification. 
4: yes, we can use an IMU, I use the gry instead of acc.
